# Full-Stack Daily Progress

Hey — this is my messy, real, daily log of learning full-stack web dev. Small experiments, little projects whatever I made that day goes here. Nothing fancy — just code + notes so I actually build stuff every day.

---

## Why this repo
- Code a little bit every day — small tasks add up over time.
- Drop in some notes or quick thoughts so I can look back later.
- Keep things simple enough that I (or anyone else) can run the code or share a quick demo.

---

## How I use this repo
1. Create a new folder for each day or exercise: `Day-<n>` or `Exercise-<n>`.
2. Put codes inside.
3. Commit with a msg and push to `main`.
