						Every morning, I love you Sonu. when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled
						dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible
						vermin.
					</p>
					<br />

					<p>
						He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little
						he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches
						into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover it and
						seemed ready to slide off any moment.
					</p>
					<br />

					<p>
						His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of
						him, waved about helplessly as he looked. "What's happened to me? "
						he thought. It wasn't a dream.
					</p>
					<br />

					<p>
						His room, a proper human room although a little too small, lay
						peacefully between its four familiar walls.
					</p>
					<br />

					<p>
						A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table - Samsa
						was a travelling salesman - and above it there hung a picture that
						he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a
						nice, gilded frame. It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and
						fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the
						whole of her lower arm towards the viewer. Gregor then turned to
						look out the window at the dull weather. Drops

						A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like
						these sweet mornings of spring which I enjoy with my whole heart.
					</p>
					<br />

					<p>
						I am alone, and feel the charm of existence in this spot, which was
						created for the bliss of souls like mine. I am so happy, my dear
						friend, so absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere tranquil
						existence, that I neglect my talents.
					</p>
					<br />

					<p>
						I should be incapable of drawing a single stroke at the present
						moment; and yet I feel that I never was a greater artist than now.
					</p>
					<br />

					<p>
						When, while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me, and the
						meridian sun strikes the upper surface of the impenetrable foliage
						of my trees, and but a few stray gleams steal into the inner
						sanctuary, I throw myself down among the tall grass by the trickling
						stream; and, as I lie close to the earth, a thousand unknown plants
						are noticed by me: when I hear the buzz of the little world among
						the stalks, and grow familiar with the countless indescribable forms
						of the insects and flies, then I feel the presence of the Almighty,
						who formed us in his own image, and the breath
